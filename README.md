- A university-level social-educational Web application.
- It allows the student community to make their public profiles by which they can exchange information, contribute, poll, and establish communities within the university.
- With more and more colleges and institutions adopting digital means of connecting, students find it difficult to surf across these multiple sources to stay updated.
- So, we decided to build this one-stop solution. This user-friendly website will facilitate dynamic cross-generational knowledge exchange and aims to unite seniors and juniors and foster mentorship and community interaction within the campus.
- Our objective is to seamlessly unite and empower students through the power of social media and digital interaction.
- Our website will be based on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google Groups, MS Teams, and much more.  We will be referring to these websites for insights and their ideologies.
- Themes - Light and Dark.
